PATHOLOGY:
4/28/16 prostate bx:
      A.  Prostate, right base #1, biopsy: Adenocarcinoma Gleason grade 6
      (3+3) involving 10% of one core. 
 
      B.  Prostate, right base #2, biopsy: Benign prostate tissue. 
 
      C.  Prostate, right mid #1, biopsy: Benign prostate tissue. 
 
      D.  Prostate, right mid #2, biopsy: Benign prostate tissue. 
 
      E.  Prostate, right apex, biopsy: Benign prostate tissue. 
 
      F.  Prostate, left base #1, biopsy: Adenocarcinoma Gleason grade 8
      (4+4) involving 60% of one core. 
 
      G.  Prostate, left base #2, biopsy: Adenocarcinoma Gleason grade 7
      (3+4) involving 50% of one core. 
 
      H.  Prostate, left mid #1, biopsy: Adenocarcinoma Gleason grade 6
      (3+3) involving <2% of one core. 
 
      I.  Prostate, left mid #2, biopsy: Adenocarcinoma Gleason grade 6
      (3+3) involving 15% of one core. 
 
      J.  Prostate, left apex, biopsy: Benign prostate tissue. 

IMPRESSION:
69 y/o with high risk prostate cancer. Assuming CT and Tc99 do not show evidence 
of disease spread, discussed options for treatment including surgery, ADT + 
EBRT, and trimodality therapy with ADT + EBRT + brachy boost. At this time 
patient is leaning towards trimodality therapy, as it provides the ability for 
shorter ADT duration. We will therefore start casodex today and meet with him 
after his scans to finalize a treatment plan.

RECOMMENDATION:
- Tc99 scan today and CT A/P 6/9/16
- MRI prostate ordered for late June to assess for ECE/SVI
- RTC after CT scan to finalize treatment plan, and if he wishes to pursue 
radiation, will start ADT at that time
- Patient is candidate for RTOG 0924 looking at treating pelvic LNs versus not, 
and will discuss study with him at next visit
- Patient will contact us with questions or concerns

05/27/2016 ADDENDUM                      STATUS: COMPLETED
I saw the patient with the resident and agree with his note.
The patient is a 69 year old male with stage group IIB, T1c N0 Mx adenoca of the 
prostate, Gleason's 4+4 in 1 core with a total of 5 of 10 cores positive for 
disease , PSA 5.65 ng/ml

he is referred to us to discuss options for treatment.

AUA score- 1
IEFF- uses viagra
exam- KPS 90
pain-0

no contrindications to therapy

impression- high risk prostate cancer

plan
1) complete staging with bone scan and obtain mpMRI in 4 weeks which will 9 
weeks post biopsy. Look for ECE or seminal vesical invasion. start casodex now. 
Lupron in 2-3 weeks. recommend IMRT x 5 weeks, hormones and seed boost. given 
AUA score, age and grade, combined modality RT is recommended. patient wants to 
avoid risk of incontinence.

will rtc in 4-6 weeks to go over results of scans and confirm treatment.
