RADONC CONSULT
Date: 09/22/2016 17:14   Author: Dr. ABC
Location: RADIOTHERAPY CONSULT  

ENCOUNTER DATE: SEP 22, 2016

PATIENT IDENTIFICATION: Doug Smith

DIAGNOSIS: 
Prostate adenocarcinoma, cT1cN0M0, GS 7(3+4), PSA 23.4ng/ml, high risk

HISTORY:
Mr. Smith is a 64y MALE who presented for a routine follow up visit in March 
2016.  A PSA drawn at that time was noted to be elevated at 23.4 ng/ml.  This 
elevation prompted a workup from urology which included a TRUS-guided prostate 
biopsy on 6/20/16.  Pathology from this procedure revealed GS 7 (3+4) prostate 
adenocarcinoma in 7/14 cores, PNI+.  Mr. Smith' cancer was localized on the left 
side, with the right side demonstrating an acute and chronic prostatitis. 
Nuclear medicine bone scan from 7/19/16 demonstrated no definite evidence of 
metastatic bone disease.  CT abdomen and pelvis 8/1/16 was also performed 
revealing a moderately enlarged prostate gland with no enlarged lymph nodes.

Mr. Smith presents today for discussion regarding radiation therapy in the 
setting of his high risk prostate adenocarcinoma.  In general, he feels well. 
He continues to work full time.  He denies any urinary symptoms of urgency, 
frequency, hesitancy, incontinence, retention.  He is sexually active and denies 
any sexual dysfunction.

        -Negative for malignancy. 
 
      II.  "LEFT PROSTATE NEEDLE BIOPSY" 
 
        -Prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 7(3+4), involving 7 out of 
          8 cores and measuring approximately 4.4cm out of a total aggregate 
          length of 9.2cm, see comment. 
        -Perineural invasion present.
 

ASSESSMENT:


PLAN: I discussed with Mr. Smith his diagnosis of a high risk 
prostate cancer and that his recommmended treatment options for his cancer are 
surgery vs. radiation therapy.  He has already discussed with urology his 
surgical treatment options.

With respect to radiation therapy, his option is external beam radiation 
therapy +/-brachytherapy with 28 months of androgen deprivation therapy (2 
months neoadjuvant, concurrent, 24 months adjuvant). 

He understands that should he choose external beam radiation therapy, this is 
provided daily over ~9 weeks.  He understands that prior to undergoing this 
radiation therapy a CT simulation is performed for treatment planning purposes. 
Side effects of external beam radiation therapy are discussed and include, but 
are not limited to, fatigue, increases in urinary urgency, frequency, nocturia, 
dysuria, hematuria, loose stools, tenesmus, sexual dysfunction, small risk of 
urethral stricture and proctitis.  In addition to the side effects of external 
beam radiation therapy side effects of androgen deprivation therapy are also 
discussed and include, but are not limited to, fatigue, hot flashes, decreased 
libido and sexual function, and weight gain.

Mr. Smith would like to consider his treatment options.  He would like to follow 
up with me in 1 week to inform me of his decision.  I would like to repeat his 
PSA prior to his next visit. 

If at any time he has any additional questions or concerns, I encouraged him to 
contact our department.
