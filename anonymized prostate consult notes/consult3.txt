IDENTIFICATION STATEMENT:  73 year-old male with O2 dependent severe COPD with 
high risk prostate adenocarcinoma, Group IIB T2aN0M0, Gleason 8 (3+5) papable 
right nodule on DRE pretreatment PSA of 6.54 on 4/19/16 and  9.77 on 6/1/16 s/p 
TRUS on 5/19/16 demonstrating 6 out 12 positive cores with GS 8 (3+5) disease 
with a 23 cc prostate and AUA score of 21.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Tracy Jones is a 73-year-old male, who was 
found on routine PSA screening to have an elevated 
PSA of 6.54 on 4/19/16. The patient was seen by Urology on 4/22/16 and noted to 
have DRE a right nodule

 The patient then underwent a prostate biopsy on 5/19/16 which showed 6 out 12 
cores positive for prostate adenocarcinoma, Gleason 8(3+5) ranging from 30-80%. 

Staging scans with bone scan and CT abdomen/pelvis on 6/9/16 demonstrate no 
evidence of metastatic disease.  However, there are bilateral large cysts in the 
kidney and hypodensity (potential pseudocyst per radiology) in the pancreeas. 
Patient states he drank alcohol on the weekends many years ago without any known 
incidences of pain in the abdomen.

He has severe COPD oxygen dependent with recent acute bacterial exacerbation 
with pneumonia.  This has completely resolved and he is doing very well. 

His AUA score is 21 he has significant urgency, frequency and nocturia x3 a 
night. 

He is now being evaluated for radiation therapy for his prostate cancer.

Imaging: 

CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST, 06/09/16, case 2024
   Impression:
       1. Upper pole renal cysts on the right are unchanged from the 
      prior study 2. Areas of decreased attenuation in the mid and
      lower pole of the left kidney are felt to represent small cyst.
      This area was not imaged on the prior study 3. Small foci of
      decreased attenuation are noted in the left lobe the liver and
      right lobe of the liver and are too small to characterize. The
      prior study is noncontrast 3. No CT evidence for small bowel
      obstruction 4. Diverticulosis distal descending and sigmoid colon
      without CT evidence for diverticulitis 5. No significant interval
      change in calcified stone in the common bile duct without
      evidence for biliary dilatation 6. Just inferior to the pancreas
      in the region of the body is an area of decreased attenuation
      which contains air. This is not included on the prior study of
      the chest. If there is a history of prior pancreatitis the
      possibility of a pseudocyst is suggested.  7. Tiny focus of
      decreased attenuation noted in the right lobe of the liver which
      is too small to characterize. The prior study was noncontrast and
      therefore this is not well demonstrated 
 

Bone Scan results: 

    Report:
      Whole body bone scan study. 
 
      History of prostatic CA. 
 
      Following intravenous administration of 22 .0 mCi of technetium 
      MDP 3 hour delayed scan shows no evidence of abnormal tracer 
      uptake. 
 
      Mild degree of tracer uptake in the shoulders, sternoclavicular 
      joint bilateral knee and tarsal bones secondary to arthritis. 
 
      Kidneys and  bladder are well visualized. 
 
      No evidence of tracer uptake noted in the pelvic bones. 
 
      Sacrum is unremarkable.

DIAGNOSIS:  73 year-old male with high risk prostate 
adenocarcinoma, Group IIB T2aN0M0, Gleason 8 (3+5) papable right nodule on DRE 
pretreatment PSA of 6.54 on 4/19/16 and  9.77 on 6/1/16 s/p TRUS on 5/19/16 
noted to have a 23 cc prostate, AUA score of.  According James Buchanan John 
Hopkin's partin tables his risk for EPE is 45%, SV is 10%, and LN is 4%.


RECOMMENDATIONS: 

We discussed treatment options for his high-risk prostate cancer including 
surgery, radiation + long term androgen deprivation therapy.   Due to his severe 
COPD we recommended long term ADT + EBRT radiation.

We discussed the implications of his unusual GS (3+5)seen on histopathology and 
the required duration of long term ADT for high risk disease .Since this would 
be considered high risk, we would recommend 28 months of ADT.  RTOG 92-02 
evaluated the benefit of long term (28 months) androgen deprivation 
to external beam radiation therapy demonstrated a disease specific survival 
benefit in the high risk group.  In his particular case, if he cannot tolerate 
the ADT we can consider 18 months for ADT after further discussion.

We described acute and long-term side effects of radiation 
treatment.  In terms of acute side effects of treatment, we described to him 
increased urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria, soft stools, and fatigue.  In 
terms of long-term toxicities, we explained to him the risk of developing rectal 
bleeding, which is usually less than 5%, urinary obstruction, and a very small 
risk of radiation induced secondary malignancy.  He acknowledges that he 
understands our treatment recommendations and potential side effects of the 
treatment and has agreed to undergo a course of hormonal therapy and external 
beam radiation therapy. All of his questions were answered to his satisfaction. 

The logistics of treatment for radiotherapy were discussed with the patient. 
Starting the ADT with casodex at least 7 days prior to his first Eligard 
injection tentatively scheduled for 7/5/16 due to transportation issues from 
Newark.  The patient will undergo Calypso beacon placement prior to radiation 
therapy, for IGRT delivery.  A CT simulation will be scheduled 7-10 days after 
his beacon placment for daily 9 week treatment to begin shortly thereafter. 

His staging scans demonstrated significant incidental kidney cysts and 
hypodensity in the pancreas (per radiology possible pseudocyst if history of 
pancreatitis) -patient reports drinking as a young man on weekends but has no 
recollection of symptoms associated with prior pancreatitis.  Will cc this note 
Mary Weltzelberger and urology residents to follow up with findings on CT scan 
with patient in the urology department and urologists.
