Imaging: personally reviewed and described in HPI
CT Chest 3/8/24
Findings: Previously noted right upper lobe nodule definitely 
      increased between 2022 and 2023 and shows further increase in 
      size and 3 9/28/2023 exam including all components of the nodule 
      the diameter is 14 mm anterior to posterior compared with 13 mm 
      on the prior exam and 8 mm left to right transverse compared with 
      6 mm on the prior exam findings again consistent with very slow 
      growing neoplasm. The location, while difficult, may be amenable 
      to percutaneous biopsy. Recommend PET/CT. 
 
      Previously noted opacity in the right middle lobe anterior 
      bronchial image 214 of series 9 from the prior exam is again seen 
      on today's exam, image 227 of series 5 measuring 2 to 3 mm and 
      perhaps adjacent to the bronchus? This area appears stable in 
      size and could be followed up on prior exams. 
 
      Evaluation of the superficial soft tissues and axilla 
      demonstrates no definite evidence of acute pathology. Imaging of 
      the mediastinal structures reveals no definite interval change. 
 
      Imaging of the subdiaphragmatic structures reveals no definite 
      evidence of significant interval change. 
 
      Evaluation of the osseous structures reveals bridging anterior 
      osteophytes. Negative for evidence of vertebral body compression 
      fracture.

      Enlarging right upper lobe nodule which has been present since
      2020, but shows further increase in size compared with the

Assessment and Plan:
Unnamed is a 75yo MALE with history of aortic insufficiency 
status post aortic valve root repair with bioprosthetic valve, with a growing 
RUL nodule, now 1.4 cm, concerning for NSCLC, cT1b N0 Mx (PET Pending), Stage 
IA2. 
 
The patient's diagnosis, prognosis and treatment options were discussed in
detail.

Unfortunately, the location of this lesion makes it challenging for CT guided or 
navigational bronch biopsy. However, the RUL lesion has been growing over time 
and is concerning for NSCLC. We discussed the treatment options for early stage 
lung cancer. We discussed that lobectomy is still considered the standard of 
care. However, SBRT is a good alternative for those who are not surgical 
candidates or are not interested in surgery. We reviewed the logistics and side 
effects of lung SBRT with Mr. Unnamed.
 
-PFTs completed earlier today 
-PET scheduled 3/29/24 

Mr. Unnamed will plan to follow up after PET scan to finalize treatment 
options and decision. 

Dr. XYZ was encouraged to call us if he has any questions or
concerns. We appreciate the opportunity to participate in this
patients care.
