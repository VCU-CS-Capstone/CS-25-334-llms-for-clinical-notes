1.) Patient Notes: Mr. Smith, 64-year-old male, presents for follow-up discussion regarding radiation therapy options for high-risk prostate adenocarcinoma. He was initially seen in March 2016 for an elevated PSA level of 23.4 ng/ml, which prompted further evaluation by urology. 
A TRUS-guided biopsy on June 20, 2016, revealed Gleason score 7 (3+4) prostate adenocarcinoma in 7/14 cores, with positive neural invasion (PNI). 
The pathology report showed that the cancer was localized on the left side of the prostate, with the right side demonstrating acute and chronic prostatitis. 
Following the biopsy, Mr. Smith underwent a nuclear medicine bone scan on July 19, 2016, which did not demonstrate any definite evidence of metastatic bone disease.
A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis on August 1, 2016, revealed a moderately enlarged prostate gland with no enlarged lymph nodes.
At present, Mr. Smith reports that he is feeling well, continues to work full-time, and denies any urinary symptoms such as urgency, frequency, hesitancy, incontinence, or retention. He is also sexually active and does not report any sexual dysfunction. 
Given his localized high-risk prostate adenocarcinoma, Mr. Smith is a candidate for radiation therapy. A thorough discussion regarding the potential benefits and risks of this treatment option, including its potential impact on urinary and sexual function, is necessary to ensure that he can make an informed decision that aligns with his individual needs and goals. Further evaluation and planning for radiation therapy should be conducted.

2.) Mr. Smith, a 64-year-old male, presented to our clinic today for a discussion regarding radiation therapy in the context of his high-risk prostate adenocarcinoma. 
His initial routine follow-up appointment in March 2016 revealed an elevated PSA level of 23.4 ng/ml, prompting a urological workup. 
The subsequent transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsy on June 20, 2016, yielded pathology results of Gleason 7 (3+4) prostate adenocarcinoma in 7 of 14 cores, with perineural invasion (PNI+). 
Imaging studies, including a nuclear medicine bone scan on July 19, 2016, and a CT abdomen and pelvis on August 1, 2016, did not demonstrate any evidence of metastatic bone disease. 
The biopsy findings revealed that the patient's cancer was localized to the left side, with the right side exhibiting acute and chronic prostatitis. 
Notably, Mr. Smith has remained asymptomatic, denying any urinary symptoms of urgency, frequency, hesitancy, incontinence, or retention. 
He continues to work full-time and is sexually active without any reported sexual dysfunction. 
As we consider radiation therapy as a treatment option for his high-risk cancer, it is essential to continue monitoring his condition to ensure effective management and minimize potential complications.

3.) "Mr. Tracy Jones, a 73-year-old male, was found to have an elevated PSA level of 6.54 during routine screening on April 19, 2016. A subsequent digital rectal exam (DRE) conducted on April 22, 2016, revealed a right nodule. 
A prostate biopsy performed on May 19, 2016, confirmed the presence of prostate adenocarcinoma in 6 out of 12 cores, with a Gleason score of 8 (3+5) ranging from 30-80%. 
Imaging studies, including a bone scan and CT abdomen/pelvis, completed on June 9, 2016, showed no evidence of metastatic disease. However, the scans did reveal bilateral large cysts in the kidneys and hypodensity in the pancreas, which is likely a pseudocyst. 
The patient reports a history of social drinking on weekends, with no prior episodes of abdominal pain. Notably, he has a significant comorbidity history, including severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), for which he requires oxygen therapy.
He has also recently experienced an acute bacterial exacerbation of COPD with pneumonia, but has since made a full recovery.
The patient is currently experiencing symptoms of urgency, frequency, and nocturia, with three trips to the bathroom per night, as documented by an AUA score of 21.
He is currently being evaluated for radiation therapy as a treatment option for his prostate cancer."

4.) Mr. Smith, a 64-year-old male, was seen for a routine follow-up visit in March 2016, during which an elevated PSA of 23.4 ng/ml was noted.
A subsequent workup by urology led to a TRUS-guided prostate biopsy on June 20, 2016, which revealed a high-risk prostate adenocarcinoma with a Gleason score of 7 (3+4) in 7 of 14 core biopsies, with perineural invasion (PNI).
Imaging studies, including a nuclear medicine bone scan on July 19, 2016, and a CT abdomen and pelvis on August 1, 2016, showed no evidence of metastatic bone disease. Notably, pathology reports also revealed acute and chronic prostatitis on the right side, with the cancer localized to the left side of the prostate gland.
Mr. Smith presents today with no acute urinary symptoms, including urgency, frequency, hesitancy, incontinence, or retention, and continues to work full-time. He remains sexually active with no reported sexual dysfunction.
As we discuss radiation therapy options for his high-risk prostate cancer, it is essential to consider his overall health status, tumor location, and patient preferences to develop a personalized treatment plan.

5.) Mr. Smith, a 64-year-old male, presented for a routine follow-up visit in March 2016, where an elevated PSA level of 23.4 ng/ml was noted. This elevation prompted further evaluation by the urology department, including a TRUS-guided prostate biopsy on June 20, 2016.
The biopsy results revealed a Gleason score of 7 (3+4) primary Gleason pattern 3, indicating a moderate to high-risk prostate adenocarcinoma, with positive neurovascular invasion (PNI). The cancer was localized to the left side, and the right side showed evidence of acute and chronic prostatitis.
Radiologic imaging studies were also reviewed, including a nuclear medicine bone scan on July 19, 2016, which demonstrated no definite evidence of metastatic bone disease. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis performed on August 1, 2016, showed a moderately enlarged prostate gland with no enlarged lymph nodes.
Currently, Mr. Smith presents for discussion regarding radiation therapy in the context of his high-risk prostate adenocarcinoma. He reports feeling well, working full-time, and denies experiencing any urinary symptoms such as urgency, frequency, hesitancy, incontinence, or retention.
Mr. Smith also reports being sexually active with no sexual dysfunction.

6.)"This 65-year-old veteran presented to the clinic asymptomatic but seeking to discuss treatment options for his prostate cancer diagnosis.
His review of systems is significant for no urinary symptoms, including dysuria or hematuria, and no rectal bleeding.
The patient did complete an American Urological Association (AUA) symptom score index, which revealed a score of 18 out of 35, indicating mild to moderate lower urinary tract symptoms.
Specifically, he reported a score of 3 for urinary frequency, 3 for noturia, 1 for urgency, 3 for incomplete emptying, 4 for frequency with urgency, and 1 for weak stream.
His bowel function score was 2, indicating constipation. The patient's symptoms suggest a possible impact on his quality of life, and as such, he is a candidate for further evaluation and treatment for his prostate cancer.
As we proceed with further testing and appointments, it will be crucial to monitor and address any potential urological symptoms and comorbidities that may affect his treatment and overall well-being."

7.) Mr. Smith, a 64-year-old male, initially presented for a routine follow-up visit in March 2016, at which time his PSA level was elevated at 23.4 ng/ml.
This prompted a urology workup, which included a TRUS-guided prostate biopsy on June 20, 2016.
Pathological examination of the biopsy sample revealed a Gleason score of 7 (3+4) prostate adenocarcinoma on 7 of 14 cores, with positive perineural invasion (PNI).
Imaging studies, including a nuclear medicine bone scan on July 19, 2016, and a CT abdomen and pelvis on August 1, 2016, did not demonstrate any evidence of metastatic bone disease.
Physical examination revealed a moderately enlarged prostate gland with no enlarged lymph nodes.
At the current visit, Mr. Smith reports feeling well and continues to work full-time, denying any urinary symptoms such as urgency, frequency, hesitancy, incontinence, or retention.
He also reports being sexually active with no sexual dysfunction.
Note:
* The Gleason score of 7 (3+4) indicates a high-risk prostate cancer.
* The presence of PNI suggests a higher risk of occult lymph node involvement, which may impact treatment planning.
* The negative bone scan and CT abdomen and pelvis suggest that the cancer is localized, with no evidence of distant metastases.
* Mr. Smith's urinary and sexual function are currently normal, indicating that his cancer is not causing significant symptoms at this time.

8.) Mr. ABC, a 69-year-old gentleman with a history of hypertension and diabetes, was diagnosed with prostate cancer after presenting with an elevated PSA level.
The pathology report from his biopsy on April 28, 2016, revealed a Gleason score of 4+4 in 1 core, 60%, and 4+3 in 3 cores, with the left base being the site of the 4+4 disease.
The patient has no urinary symptoms and is experiencing normal diurnal voiding frequency, nocturia once, and no urgency, hesitancy, or hematuria.

He is sexually active and denies any sexual dysfunction.

11.) Mr. ABC, a 69-year-old gentleman, presented to discuss his newly diagnosed prostate cancer.
His initial PSA screening revealed an elevated level, leading to referral to urology, where a biopsy was performed on April 28, 2016.
Pathological analysis showed a Gleason score of 4+4 in 10% of the cores, indicative of high-grade disease, as well as Gleason scores of 3+4 and 3+3 in other core samples.
The left base of the prostate was primarily affected by the high-grade disease. The patient was asymptomatic, reporting no urinary issues, including no urgency, hesitancy, or hematuria.
However, he did experience nocturia once a night and had a normal sexual function, occasionally using sildenafil (Viagra) without his wife's knowledge.
He denied any bowel symptoms or a history of inflammatory bowel disease, lupus, or scleroderma. The patient also had a colonoscopy performed in 2014 and was planning to undergo a Tc99 scan today, as well as a CT abdominopelvic imaging study on June 7, 2016.
He sought consultation to discuss treatment options for his prostate cancer.

12.) Mr. Tracy Jones, a 73-year-old male, was initially seen in urology on 4/22/16 after a routine PSA screening revealed an elevated level of 6.54 on 4/19/16.
A digital rectal examination (DRE) at that time identified a right-sided nodule, prompting a prostate biopsy on 5/19/16.
The biopsy results showed six out of 12 cores positive for prostate adenocarcinoma, Gleason 8 (3+5) ranging from 30-80%.
A staging workup with bone scan and CT abdomen/pelvis on 6/9/16 demonstrated no evidence of metastatic disease; however, radiological findings did reveal bilateral large kidney cysts and potential pseudocysts in the pancreas.
Notably, the patient reported a history of moderate alcohol consumption on weekends, but with no reported episodes of abdominal pain.
Additionally, he has been battling severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and required oxygen therapy, having recently experienced an acute bacterial exacerbation with pneumonia, which has since resolved.
Patient-reported symptoms at this time include an AUA score of 21, characterized by significant urgency, frequency, and nocturia (requiring bathroom trips three times a night).
As a result, he is currently being evaluated as a candidate for radiation therapy to manage his prostate cancer.
