Impression/Plan:
Patient has low intermediate risk prostate cancer, Gleason's 3+4 prostate cancer 
in 2 cores, stage IIA, T1c N0 M0, PSA of 4.19
We discussed brachytherapy, surgery, external beam radiotherapy, active 
surveillance, role of hormonal therapy and the goals risks and benefits of each. 
There is a phase 3 evidence demonstrating that brachyherapy as monotherapy for 
low intermediate risk prostate cancer is appropriate to seeds + EBRT.

Patient wishes to proceed with brachytherapy.
 I would not recommend hormonal therapy for this patient.

we will schedule him for volume study and visit with Dr. Emily Jones. Patient understands that we are booked in the OR for seeds cases into 
January but that he does not wish to be treated by community MD's through Vet 
choice program. It is clinically appropriate to wait til then to treat him.
