RADIATION ONCOLOGY CONSULT

IDENTIFICATION STATEMENT: 
Mr. James is a 79 year old male with T2bN2M0 adenocarcinoma of the left lower 
lobe presenting for discussion regarding radiation therapy. 

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:

This is a 79 y/o man who underwent a routine CT scan of the chest on 7/28/16 at 
the request of his primary care physician. This study showed a 5.7 x 4.3 cm 
irregular mass in the superior segment left lower lobe highly suspicious for 
primary malignancy. PET scan on 8/30/16 showed:

Impression: 
        1. Abnormal F18 FDG-PET/CT scintigraphy. Abnormal FDG hypermetabolism 
        (SUV max: 19.6) localized to the 6.7 x 4.7 cm left lower lobe mass, 
        concerning for carcinoma.  At least 4 intense surrounding foci of FDG 
        activity within the left peribronchial/hilar region, that measure up to 
        1 cm on PET, SUV max of 8. These are concerning for locoregional 
        metastases. Also mild uptake within nonenlarged right hilar, subcarinal, 
        distal left paratracheal lymph nodes, all subcentimeter in size-these 
        are indeterminant in etiology given size and low grade uptake. 

        2. A focal 1.3 cm low-density within the posterior to mid left thyroid 
        lobe, non FDG-avid. Consider correlation with thyroid ultrasound for 
        further evaluation. 

        3. Otherwise, no evidence of hypermetabolic foci throughout the neck, 
        abdomen, or pelvis to suggest FDG avid distal spread of metastases in 
        these regions. 

CT guided biopsy of the left lower lobe lesion on 8/23/16 was positive  for 
poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, POSITIVE FOR CK7, TTF-1, NEGATIVE FOR 
CK20, CONSISTENT WITH ADENOCARCINOMA, LUNG PRIMARY. An EBUS was performed on 
10/26/16, the left hilar LN and subcarinal LN were biopsied and found to harbor 
metastatic adenocarcinoma. MRI brain on 9/26/16 was negative for metastatic 
disease.

The patient is now seen for consideration of radiation therapy. He reports that 
the 20 lb weight loss over the past 3 months was mainly due to poor nutrition as 
he has been busy taking care of his wife who is very ill. He denies any fevers, 
chills, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, chest pain, abdominal pain, hematuria, 
hematochezia, dyschezia, bone pain, motor weakness, or gait abnormalities. He 
does report an occasional cough, but productive only of clear sputum.

IMPRESSION:  79 year old male with T2bN2M0 adenocarcinoma of the left lower lobe 
presenting for discussion regarding radiation therapy. 

PLAN:

We spoke with the patient at length regarding the role of radiation therapy in 
his treatment, which would be to provide local control of his disease. While 
radiation therapy is generally well tolerated, we explained the risks involved 
and the potential adverse effects which include but are not limited to injury to 
healthy lung tissue, radiation damage to the heart or spinal cord, and
radiation induced injury to the esophagus leading to difficulty with swallowing 
or painful swallowing.

Given the advanced nature of the patient's disease, chemotherapy and radiation 
will form the cornerstone of his/her treatment. Sause et al. 2000 showed that 
chemotherapy followed by radiation for locally advanced unresectable non-small 
cell lung cancer provided a superior median survival of 13.2 months vs 11.4 
months for patients receiving radiation alone. This translated into a 5-year 
survival advantage of 8% with chemoRT vs 5% for RT alone. These findings were 
expanded upon by Curran et al. 2011 in RTOG 9410, in which they demonstrated
that concurrent cisplatin based chemoRT offers superior 5-year survival of 16% 
compared to 10% for Stage III patients receiving sequential chemoRT.

The patient understood the risks and benefits of radiation treatment and is 
agreeable to proceeding with treatment. We will plan for simulation on 11/23/16 
with his treatment to start shortly thereafter. We have also ordered a repeat 
PET scan given that his most recent scan was on 8/30/16.


  - repeat PET scan ordered
  - medical oncology consult requested by Dr. ABC, pending
  - simulation 11/23/16



This patient was seen by Dr. ABC and myself and the plan was discussed and 
developed collaboratively. 

Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the care of this patient.

I saw the patient with my resident and agree with his findings, assessment, and 
plan. Because our planning is based off PET/CT fusion and his PET is nearly 3 
months old, we ordered a new PET/CT. I personally called the chief tech at the 
Random VAMC and he said he will try to expedite Mr. James's 
scan. We scheduled him for a CT simulation to be done in one week. Will also try 
to have him see medical oncology on the same day.
