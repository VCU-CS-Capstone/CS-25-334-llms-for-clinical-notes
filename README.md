# CS-25-334 Large Language Models (LLM) for data extraction from clinical notes
## About the project
This project aims to improve the extraction of structured data from free-text clinical notes in Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) using Large Language Models (LLMs). It focuses on generating synthetic clinical notes to facilitate data extraction and sharing while maintaining patient privacy. By using curated templates and LLMs, the project creates synthetic notes that mimic real ones without exposing Protected Health Information (PHI). It also involves fine-tuning LLMs to enhance data extraction accuracy and plans to validate synthetic notes through a Turing Test-style experiment. Future developments include expanding the tool to support various clinical note types and disease sites, and creating a web-based tool for customization.
